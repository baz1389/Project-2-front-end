##Overview

This project was designed and cloned after a combination of [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) and [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/). This single-page application (SPA) allows users to read, search, define and update words or idioms/phrases. Users must create an account before being able to use the site's functionality.

- **Create my back-end**
      - What will my database need?
      - Model relationships and controller functionality.
      - What routes do I need?
- **Basic HTML/CSS implementation**
- **Ajax, jquery, and javascript implementation on the front end**
      - One method at a time.
